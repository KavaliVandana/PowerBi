2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Data cleaning was performed using Power Query:

Handled missing/null values

Removed duplicate records

Standardized text values

Trimmed extra spaces using Trim and Clean

Removed unnecessary columns

Split and merged columns where required

3. Data Transformation

Created new calculated columns

Filtered and grouped data

Renamed columns for clarity

Prepared business-ready, analysis-ready data

4. Data Modeling

Built relationships between tables

Followed Star Schema approach

Fact tables

Dimension tables

Ensured accurate aggregations and filtering across visuals

5. DAX Measures

Created calculated measures using DAX:

Total values (SUM)

Average calculations

Count-based metrics

Basic time-based comparisons (year-wise analysis)

Worked with filter context for accurate results

6. Visualization & Dashboards

Designed interactive dashboards using:

Bar charts & Line charts

KPI cards

Tables & matrices

Slicers and filters

Enabled:

Cross-filtering

Drill-down functionality

Tooltips for additional context

7. Publishing & Deployment
